# Lighthouse Windows 10 WSL Setup

## Quick Start

If you are familiar with using PowerShell and the command line interface:

1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Execute the following Command:
```
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://git.io/JM2dE'))
```
- Don't forget to reboot after Step 1 (if required)
- For Step 3 (Import) and later, open PowerShell normally, not as Admin
